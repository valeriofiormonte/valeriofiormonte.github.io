      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p style="line-height:1.5em;">The project followed a structured, end-to-end approach.

It started with a market and competitor analysis to understand positioning, feature gaps and differentiation opportunities within the SEO tools landscape. Based on these insights, I contributed to defining the product strategy and business plan.

During the concept phase, I worked closely with the graphic design team to shape the product vision, while coordinating UX and development teams to ensure alignment between user needs, design decisions and technical constraints throughout the execution.</p>

      <h2>Outcome &amp; Results</h2>
      <p>The project led to a well-defined and scalable SEO software concept, grounded in market insights and user-centered design principles.

The structured process improved cross-team alignment and reduced friction between strategy, design and development, enabling a smoother transition from concept to implementation and setting solid foundations for future product growth.</p>
